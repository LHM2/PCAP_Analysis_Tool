# PCAP_Analysis_Tool
## Basic Description
An innovative tool with a primary objective of identifying and notifying the user of network attacks in PCAPs.

## Background
This tool was created as part of my dissertation. The idea of this software was to fill a gap in the currently available tools and provide something that will easily identify various network attacks and display them to the user - who can then proceed to use a more indepth, low-level tool to appropriately investigate the attack (such as wireshark). To appropriately meet this goal, the tool had to be minimalistic, simple and efficient in order to allow the user to quickly analyse large PCAPs and progress in their investigation. Therefore, an equally important objective was to provide a suitable, high-level GUI that provides only necessary information that can quickly be digested.

## Current Capabilities

- SYN Flood Attack
- ARP Poisoning Attack

## Future Goals

Ultimately, I want to both add to the tools capabilities - with regard to identifying attacks and specific additional features - and improve current features to increase efficieny.

## License

Currently there is no license, so the default copyright laws apply - No redistribution, reproduction or addition to the project etc. This is mainly due to the fact that I want to keep working on this as a pastimme. However, I do encourage you to download the project if you wish to use it for personal reasons and provide feedback, critisicm, suggest addition of or changes to features etc.
